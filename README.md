# Assignment-4

I created a knexfile to connect my databse to my express server, i created the 4 buttons in my index.html and made the queries using UI to trigger the 4 routes in my server.js. I wrote 4 queries, one to create a table, one to insert some data, one to delete and one to update.
I created 2 columns "id_users" and "name" in a new table called "Test". I was able to insert some values in each column, The create query works correctly. On pg admin i can see my new table with the columns and their values. Also, i was able to fix my second assignment which now works well and i added the 4 buttons to make the UI requests. My server is running correctly, i just need to fix the fact that i can't retrieve my values from my table and show it to the user. The error i'm getting is that sqllite doesn't recognize my query in my server.js when i want to retrieve a name i put in my column. I don't get it since i'm using postgres and i made sure sqllite was deleted from the dependencies in my package.json file.

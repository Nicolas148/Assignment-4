# Assignment-4

I created a knexfile to connect my databse to my express server, i created the 4 buttons in my index.html and made the queries using UI to trigger the 4 routes in my server.js. However i'm unable to create a table from my knexfile in my database when i write npx knex migrate:latest --knexfile Database/knexfile.js, it says i don't have the right. I tried to give me the right but each time it says i can't. I don't know what should i do, my code should work as soon as i get the permission to create from outside pg admin. I wrote 4 querie, one to create a table, one to insert some data, one to delete and one to update.

# Assignment-4

I created a knexfile to connect my databse to my express server, i created the 4 buttons in my index.html and made the queries using UI to trigger the 4 routes in my server.js. I wrote 4 querie, one to create a table, one to insert some data, one to delete and one to update.
However i created 2 columns "id_users" and "name" in a new table called "Test". I was able to insert 1 value in each column, 2 for id_users and "dupont" for the name column. On pg admin i can see my new table with the columns and their values. That being said, i was able to fix my second assignment which now works well and i added the 4 buttons to make the UI requests. My server is running correctly, i just need to fix the fact that i can't retrieve my values from my table and show it to the user.

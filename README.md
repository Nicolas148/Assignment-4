# Assignment-4

I created a knexfile to connect my databse to my express server, i created the 4 buttons in my index.html and made the queries using UI to trigger the 4 routes in my server.js. I wrote 4 querie, one to create a table, one to insert some data, one to delete and one to update.
However i don't know how to create values for my tables using knex, i created 2 columns "id_users" and "name" in a new table called "Test" but i don't know how to insert some values inside the columns. That being said, i was ableto fix my second assignment which now works well and i added the 4 buttons to make the UI requests. My server is running correctly, i just need to fix this insertion problem.
